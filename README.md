# Customer-s-Conversion-Prediction

Given various Information related to a customerâ€™s behavior in online shopping websites,
I created a model that can predict whether that customer will generate revenue for the website's company or not. 
=> Binary Classification ; I Got the best results by using XGBoost with 96% accuracy;
